=== TO DO ===

- set an upper default limit for HttpRequest request size when fetching feeds
  doing a HEAD request first to ask for the size but that value may not be
  available. Check how much data is returned as its coming back
  in which case you'd override the content fetch callback and count data as it
  comes in or check the header, again, if it's provided, at the start of data
  coming in. Then you could abort cleanly once it's gotten too much
  (otherwise using the defaults - PHP will abort the entire program when your
  memory usage gets too high)

- This is currently an open issue:
  Suggestion: add a new parameter to limit the number of characters when
  rendering the channel item <description>.
  https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30377#c5
  The length limitation must be HTML tag-safe, but it is not at the moment.
  Length limitation is disabled by default.

=== Version 2.18 2013-02-20 ===
* release version

  Version 2.18 submits the unported and reverted changes from the former SVN
  repository version. In the transition phase from SVN to Git/Gerrit,
  formerly unreviewed changes stayed in the Gerrit limbus from April 2012 to
  February 2013 and were reviewed there and further improved.

  With version 2.18, all these pending changes were reviewed and become now
  available in the Git repository.

=== Version 2.17 2012-12-30 ===
* code cosmetics

=== Version 2.12 2012-03-07 ===
* bug fix 34763 "RSS feed items (HTML) are not rendered as HTML but htmlescaped"
* regression bug 30377 "Add a new parameter to limit the number of characters
  when rendering the channel item <description>". Feed item string length
  limitation is difficult when we allow HTML <a> or <img> tags, because a mere
  content-unaware limitation breaks (can break) tags which results in disastrous
  rendering results.

=== Version 2.11 2012-02-29 ===
* function name typo correction

=== Version 2.10 2012-02-27 ===
* final solution of bug 30028 "Error parsing XML for RSS" - improve and harden
  Extension:RSS when parsing differently flavoured RSS feeds and ATOM feeds
* new parameter $wgRSSUrlNumberOfAllowedRedirects (default = 0)
  Some feed urls redirect. The new RSS version can deal with redirects,
  but it must be expressly enabled. For example, you can set
  $wgRSSUrlNumberOfAllowedRedirects = 1;

=== Version 2.01 2012-02-24 ===
* "summary" element of ATOM feed items are shown
  which is handled like "description" element of RSS
* handling of basic HTML layout tags <p> <br> <b> <i> <u> <s> in item description

=== Version 2.00 2012-02-24 ===
* first version which can parse RSS and at least some ATOM feeds
  partial solution of bug 30028 "Error parsing XML for RSS" - improve and harden
  Extension:RSS when parsing differently flavoured RSS feeds and ATOM feeds

=== Version 1.94 2012-02-23 ===
* changed white list definition and behavior:

  1. changed the name from $wgRSSAllowedFeeds to $wgRSSUrlWhitelist
  2. behavior has been changed

  the new behavior is:
  $wgRSSUrlWhitelist is empty by default. Since version 1.94 it must be
  expressly set to an array( list-of-comma-separated-allowed-RSS-urls-strings )
  or set to array( "*" ) if you want to allow any url

  the old behavior was:
  $wgRSSAllowedFeeds was empty by default and empty meant that every Url
  was allowed by default. This has been changed, see new behavior.

=== Version 1.92 2012-02-13 ===
* added optional date= attribute and $wgRSSDateDefaultFormat parameter
* added optional item-max-length= attribute and $wgRSSItemMaxLength parameter
  fixes bug 30377 add a new parameter to limit the number of characters when
  rendering the channel item <description>
  (update: this fix is reverted, the bug 30377 re-opened with version 2.17)

=== Version 1.90 2011-08-15 ===
* removed parsing of each single channel subelement (item)
* only the finally constructed feed is sent to the recursive parser:
  in pre-1.9 versions, each channel subelement (item) was sent to the parser
* [[MediaWiki:Rss-item]] default has channel subelement <description> added
* Rss template default name has been changed:

  until 1.8:  [[Template:RSSPost]]
        1.9:  [[MediaWiki:Rss-feed]], an existing [[Template:RSSPost]]
	      takes precedence to be compatible to pre-1.9 versions
* introducing [[MediaWiki:Rss-feed]] with a meaningful default.
  The channel subelements which make the feed are rendered in this
  new standard layout:
  * <title>
  : <description>
  : <author> <date>
* There are several ways to customize the final layout of feed items:
  1. Admins can change the [[MediaWiki:Rss-feed]] default page
  2. Users can use the optional template= parameter to tell the extension
     to render the feed with a different layout
     <rss template=Pagename>...</rss> use layout as in [[Template:Pagename]]
  3. <rss template=Namespace:Pagename>...</rss> use [[Namespace:Pagename]]

=== Version 1.8 2010-10-19 ===
* removed dependencies on Snoopy in favor of MediaWiki's internal HttpRequest
* removed MagpieRSS (perhaps to be replaced later with SimplePie)
  because of concerns about MagpieRSS's security problems and
  lack of maintenance.
* Added ability to do more with the layout of RSS feeds.

=== Version 1.7 2010-07-23 ===
* cleaned up, included MagpieRSS library
* put into the WMF subversion repository by Jeroen De Dauw
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Jeroen_De_Dauw
* i18n file added by TranslateWiki.net people
